    <h1>who we are </h1>
        <p>We believe strongly in the role that higher education plays in supporting a thriving society. Colleges and universities not only prepare students for their chosen path but they help create the next generation of citizen leaders and problem solvers. Higher education institutions pursue a distinct and enduring mission in our society, dedicated solely to the creation 
            and dissemination of knowledge. The breadth and richness of the fabric that comprises the worldâ€™s institutions of higher learning are integral to long-term human advancement and well-being.</p>
